S2S is a Solver for Second-order Separation logic. It supports
constraints in separation logic combining with
general inductive definitions, arithmetic and string.
S2S includes a central component of a generic cyclic proof framework.
Currently, three cyclic-proof instantiations have been implemented:
two solvers of separation logic (one for satisfiability and one for entailment)
and one satisfiability solver of string logic.
