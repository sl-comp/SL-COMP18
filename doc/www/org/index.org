* Synopsis
   {{{sl-comp}}} is an initiative for collecting decision problems in {{{SL}}}
   and solvers dealing with such problems.

   This initiative started in 2014 and it was inspired by the very
   popular initiatives on other theories, like 
   first-order theories for {{{SMT-COMP}}} and 
   Boolean constraints for {{{SAT-COMP}}}.

* News
  - *June 25*: Solver registration ended. 
  - *June 18*: [[https://github.com/sl-comp/SL-COMP18/master/tree/bench][New benchmarks]] have been added. /Many thanks to contributors!/
  - *May 23*: [[file:CFP.md][Call for comments, solvers, and benchmarks]] issued.
  - *January 2018*: Announcement of the second edition of SL-COMP: it will
    be hosted by [[http://adsl.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr][ADSL workshop]] at [[http://www.floc2018.org][FLOC'18]] in July 13th 2018.

* Key Dates
  - *July 1*: first round of the competition
  - *July 8*: last round of the competition
  - *July 13*: presentation at [[http://adsl.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr][ADSL 2018]];
    *all participants are welcome to present their solver!*

* Introduction

{{{SL}}} (SL) is an established and fairly popular Hoare logic
for the imperative, heap-manipulating programs.
#+INDEX: Separation Logic

Its high expressivity, its ability to generate compact proofs and its
support for local reasoning motivated the development of [[http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/p.ohearn/SeparationLogic/Separation_Logic/Tools.html][tools]] for
automatic reasoning about programs using dynamic memory and whose
properties are specified using SL.

These tools intensively use (semi-)decision procedures for checking
satisfiability and entailment problems in SL. In the last ten years,
[[file:papers.org][several papers]] reported on the design and implementation of such
solvers.
#+INDEX: decision procedures

To improve the status of these solvers and to motivate the research in
this area, [[https://cs.nyu.edu/pipermail/smt-comp/2014/000278.html][we started in May 2014]] a competition of solvers for
Separation Logic problems. This competition was inspired by the very
popular competitions on other logic theories, e.g., {{{SMT-COMP}}} 
and {{{SAT-COMP}}}.
This first edition of SL-COMP has been held with the support of the
{{{StarExec}}} platform and of SMT-COMP officers, mainly David Cok. 
#+INDEX: SMT-COMP
#+INDEX: SAT-COMP
#+INDEX: StarExec

The input format of problems extended the format {{{SMT-LIB}}} with SL
constructs. This format has been changed for the second edition of
{{{SL-COMP}}} in 2018 to better exploit the new features of
{{{SMT-LIB}}} like datatypes definition and mutually recursive functions.
#+INDEX: SMT-LIB

* Specifications and rules
  The input problems are specified using the format described [[https://github.com/sl-comp/SL-COMP18/master/tree/input/Docs/][here]] and
  commented in this [[https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=fr#!topic/sl-comp/3j8iaaLvTWs][post]].

  Problems to be solved are either satisfiability problems or
  entailment problems. An entailment problem consists in checking the
  validity of the formula $A \models B$ and it is coded by the formula
  $A \land \lnot B$.

  The possible answers of a solver are: *sat*, *unsat*, *unknown*.

  The solvers shall run on the {{{StarExec}}} platform.
  Solvers may use a pre-processor to transform the input file format to
  the solver's format. The input problems are not scrambled.

* Benchmarks and divisions
#+NAME: bench
- SL-COMP 2018 collected [[https://github.com/sl-comp/SL-COMP18/tree/master/bench][a set of 1296 problems]].
   This set includes the one in the 2014 edition (678 problems, see below) and new problems.
   The current set of problems is split into the following divisions:
  + Satisfiability checking:
    - [[https://github.com/sl-comp/SL-COMP18/tree/master/bench/qf_shls_sat][=qf_shls_sat=]]: for quantifier free (QF) formulas in the symbolic heaps (SH) fragment using only acyclic singly linked lists
    - [[https://github.com/sl-comp/SL-COMP18/tree/master/bench/qf_shid_sat][=qf_shid_sat=]]: for QF formulas in the SH fragment using general inductive definitions (ID)
    - [[https://github.com/sl-comp/SL-COMP18/tree/master/bench/qf_shidlia_sat][=qf_shidlia_sat=]]: for QF formulas in the SH fragment with ID and linear integer constraints (LIA)
    - [[https://github.com/sl-comp/SL-COMP18/tree/master/bench/qf_bsl_sat][=qf_bsl_sat=]]: for QF fragment with boolean combination of SL atoms
    - [[https://github.com/sl-comp/SL-COMP18/tree/master/bench/qf_bsllia_sat][=qf_bsllia_sat=]]: for QF fragment with boolean combination of SL atoms and LIA
    - [[https://github.com/sl-comp/SL-COMP18/tree/master/bench/bsl_sat][=bsl_sat=]]: for boolean combination of SL atoms

  + Entailment checking:
    - [[https://github.com/sl-comp/SL-COMP18/tree/master/bench/qf_shls_entl][=qf_shls_entl=]]: for QF formulas in the SH fragment using only acyclic singly linked lists
    - [[https://github.com/sl-comp/SL-COMP18/tree/master/bench/qf_shid_entl][=qf_shid_entl=]]: for QF formulas in the SH fragment with ID
    - [[https://github.com/sl-comp/SL-COMP18/tree/master/bench/qf_shlid_entl][=qf_shlid_entl=]]: for QF formulas in the SH fragment with linear ID
    - [[https://github.com/sl-comp/SL-COMP18/tree/master/bench/shid_entl][=shid_entl=]]: for formulas in the SH fragment with ID
    - [[https://github.com/sl-comp/SL-COMP18/tree/master/bench/qf_shidlia_entl][=qf_shidlia_entl=]]: for formulas in the SH fragment with ID and LIA
    - [[https://github.com/sl-comp/SL-COMP18/tree/master/bench/shidlia_entl][=shidlia_entl=]]: for QF formulas in the SH fragment with IS and LIA

- SL-COMP 2014 collected [[https://github.com/mihasighi/smtcomp14-sl/tree/master/bench][a set of 678 problems]]
  with the following properties:
  + 25% satisfiability problems versus 75% entailment problems
  + 41% crafted problems versus 59% random generated problems
  + The problems were split in four divisions:
    - /=sll0a_sat=/: satisfiability problems for the SH fragment
      with a unique inductive definition (ID) specifying acyclic singly linked list
    - /=sll0a_entl=/: entailment problems for the above fragment
    - /=FDB_entl=/: entailment problems for the SH fragment
      with linear ID specifying various kinds of lists
      in a restricted way
    - /=UDB_sat=/: satisfiability problems for the SH fragment
      with general, user defined ID specifying lists, trees, etc
    - /=UDB_entl=/: entailment problems for the above fragment

- The contributions to the benchmark of SL-COMP are summarized below:
