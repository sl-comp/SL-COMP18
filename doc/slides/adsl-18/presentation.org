** Separation Logic Competition, SL-COMP

Started in 2014 as a satellite event of SMT-COMP 2014:
# FLOC Olympic Games:
- Objectives:
  + promote the implementation effort on solvers for SL
  + share a benchmark of interesting problems
  + compare methods
- Results:
  + 6 solvers
  + 678 problems, 25% sat and 75% entailment
  + common input format based on SMT-LIB 2.0
  + \alert{5} divisions, mainly \alert{quantifier free} formulas with
    in \alert{symbolic heap} fragment with specific (e.g., /=lseg=/)
    or general inductive definitions


** The second edition, SL-COMP 2018

Same objectives, \alert{new results}:
- \alert{new input format}, aligned with SMT-LIB 2.6
- \alert{+4} (initially +6) solvers
- \alert{+618} new benchmarks, some fixes on old bench
- \alert{+6} divisions, better naming

However
NB: rules are not yet defined, very flexible, on demand
- solver binary running on StarExec
- by default: 600 sec of timeout and 4 GB of memory
  + increased to 2400 then 3600 if ressourced out

* Dynamic Results

** Execution of StarExec

NB: rules are not yet defined, very flexible, on demand
- solver binary running on StarExec
- by default: 600 sec of timeout and 4 GB of memory
  + increased to 2400 then 3600 if ressourced out
- one solver (ComSPEN) gave up because of StarExec
- 3 or 4 rounds, depending on
  + availability of the final version of the solver
  + results obtained


** Division /=qf_shls_entl=/

- Origin: /=sll0a_entl=/ of SL-COMP'14
- 7 solvers, 296 problems
- mainly run with 600 sec and 4GB

\alert{Entry division, may reveal solver's inconsistencies.}

** Division /=qf_shls_sat=/

- Origin: /=sll0a_sat=/ of SL-COMP'14
- 7 solvers, 110 problems
- mainly run with 600 sec and 4GB

\alert{PTIME algorithm, not for proof techniques}
